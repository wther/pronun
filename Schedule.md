Delivery Schedule & Work Log
============================

As part of the assigment I'm required to lay down a plan about what I'm going to do the next semester. Additionally, I'll be expected to attach a **work log** to the paper I'll have to write once I'm finished. As I'm still learning most of the technologies I'm planning to use, and it's hard to see how much time I'll be able to set aside for the project I'm sure I won't be able to follow the plan to the letter.

2nd week - February 23
----------------------

By the second week I'd like to familiarize myself with the technologies used to **record and play back** audio in the browser. I'll also study available libraries and tools, and select the ones best fitting my needs.

I'll also study the Java EE platform and Maven, and I'll implement the outline of the server side application.

4th week - March 9
------------------

I wish to implement a demo of the final appliction by the 4th week capable of sending hand made samples to the browser, playing them, and allowing the user to compare them to their own voices.

6th week - March 23
-------------------

By the 6th week a wish to finish most of the crucial features of the application, as I'll be leaving to Amsterdam for 2 weeks afterwards, and when I return I'll be in the middle of my exam period.

In this beta application most **client side features should be done**, and the server should contain the interfaces required to handle and process the samples, which basically means that a **database** and its handlers should be implemented a this point.

I'll also attempt to implement some **sample gathering logic**, as in the final application the samples shouldn't be created manually, there has to be some kind of automation responsible for generating them.

10th week - April 20
--------------------

At this point the client side features will need to be tested and improved, and the database interface has to be finalized. Additionally, the automation generating the samples has to finished, and it has to be tested. 

12th week - May 4
-----------------

As the project matures, I'm sure I'll come with tons of potential new features. If there aren't many left over work items at this point, I'll be working on the new features.

I'll also start writing the documentation, which shouldn't require too much effort, as I'm planning on documenting most of the work done, here on Github.

13th week - May 11
-----------------

All still unfinished features have to be either rapidly finished or excluded from the final application. No further development should be required after this point. I'll be preparing the paper I'll have to hand in, and the presentation on the finished application.
