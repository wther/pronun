English Pronunciation Trainer
======

This project is mainly academical and attempts to create an application helping non-native speakers to improve their English pronunciation or learn different types of English accents. 

Inspirations
-------

 * There are countless videos on you Youtube depicting a specific word or phrase and **explaining its proper pronunciation** (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR_AhXb8tTg)
 * Various websites and mobile apps provide **pronounce a word** functionality (e.g. http://www.pronouncehow.com/english/miscellaneous_pronunciation)
 * Various mobile apps are trying to teach English, some even use the **phone's microphone** to make you pronounce a certain word or phrase (e.g. Duolingo)
 * Google's speech recognition has proven that good quality **speech to word** recognition is possible. (Try: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html)
 * There are a few open source libraries offering **speech to phoneme** or **speech to text** conversion (http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/)
 * Accents, pronunciation, speech recognition and sound processing is a widely researched field

Project outline
-------

OK, so what I'd like to do, is to put all these tools together and create a simple but effective way to train your English pronunciation on a daily basis. 

The idea is that the application will give you phrases that you have to say out loud, and then you'll be able to compare the way you pronounced the words to how a native speaker would pronounce it. 

### Milestones 1 - Demo ###

The target of the first milestone is to familiarize myself with the basic concepts needed to create a Web-based, thin-client application, thus the title: "JavaEE based web applications".  I will create a demo with the following functionality:
 * The server stores and manages the **native phrase samples** and their meta information (phonemes, text, etc.)
 * Users can record themselves pronounce a phrases and they can **hear their voice compared to a native speaker**.
 * I do not wish the create education content myself, and the demo will not try the algorithmically compare the recorded and native samples.
 
In order to achieve this I will familiarize myself with the following subjects:
 * Science behind voice, phonemes, pronunciation and accents
 * HTML5 and client side scripting, controlling a device's microphone
 * JavaEE application development, database management, etc.
 * Sound and voice processing, data mining for usable samples.
